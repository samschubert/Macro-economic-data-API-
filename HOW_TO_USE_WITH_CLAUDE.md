```
I've uploaded 5 charts and provided a comprehensive data brief about the copper/gold ratio as a leading risk-on indicator.

Please write this as a punchy X/Twitter thread (15-20 tweets) with this structure:

HOOK: Start with "The copper/gold ratio just hit 50-year lows. That's not bearish—it's the biggest risk-on signal you're not watching."

FOCUS ON:
- The 6-month lead on manufacturing (0.845 correlation) - this is the killer stat
- Liquidity indicators all turning positive (SOFR, M2, Fed pivot)
- Bitcoin cycle timing: Cu/Au peaks preceded 2013/2017/2021 tops by 12-60 days
- Current Cu/Au at LOWS means we're EARLY, not late
- Dollar down 10% adds fuel

STYLE:
- Contrarian but backed by hard data
- Include specific numbers (0.845 correlation, 50-year lows, etc.)
- Each tweet should flow to the next
- Use charts references (Chart 1, Chart 2, etc.)
- End with actionable insight

Make it provocative but credible. This needs to cut through noise on X.
```

## Alternative: Get Analysis First

If you want Claude to analyze before writing:

### Prompt Option A: Analysis First
```
I've uploaded 5 charts showing the copper/gold ratio as a leading economic indicator.

Can you:
1. Analyze each chart and extract the key insights
2. Identify the strongest data points for a contrarian "risk-on incoming" thesis
3. Suggest the most compelling narrative structure
4. Point out any potential weaknesses in the argument

Then I'll have you write the article.
```

### Prompt Option B: Specific Format
```
Using these charts and data, write this in the format of a Zerohedge/Bloomberg article:

- Attention-grabbing headline
- 3-4 sentence lead that summarizes the thesis
- Data-heavy body with specific statistics
- Charts embedded with analysis
- Contrarian angle throughout
- 3-paragraph conclusion with trading implications
```

### For Data Analysis:
- Upload `macro_data_export.csv` and ask Claude to analyze specific correlations
- Ask: "What other correlations in this dataset support the thesis?"
- Request: "Find the strongest statistical evidence for the 3-6 month lead"

### For Article Polishing:
- Ask Claude to "Make this more accessible to retail investors"

## Example Full Prompt

```
CONTEXT:
I have data showing the copper/gold ratio at 50-year lows, with historical evidence it leads manufacturing/ISM by 6 months (0.845 correlation).

I've uploaded 5 charts showing:
1. Cu/Au leading manufacturing by 6 months
2. Cu/Au vs S&P 500 correlation
3. Cu/Au vs Bitcoin with cycle peak timing
4. Liquidity dashboard (SOFR, M2, Fed BS, credit spreads)
5. Cu/Au vs Dollar inverse relationship

[PASTE ENTIRE ARTICLE_BRIEF.md HERE]

TASK:
Write a 15-tweet thread that:
- Hooks with "50-year lows" angle
- Builds case with specific data (0.845 correlation, liquidity stats)
- Addresses Bitcoin cycle timing (early vs late)
- Makes it contrarian but credible
- Each tweet flows naturally to next
- Ends with actionable insight

TONE: Confident but data-driven. Like a macro analyst who found something everyone missed.

START WITH: "The copper/gold ratio just hit 50-year lows. That's not bearish—it's the biggest risk-on signal you're not watching."
