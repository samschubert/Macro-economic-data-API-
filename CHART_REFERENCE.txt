COPPER/GOLD RATIO ANALYSIS - CHART REFERENCE
============================================

CURRENT DATA (Feb 2026):
- Copper/Gold Ratio: 0.001262 (50-year lows)
- Copper: $5.35 per pound
- Gold: $5,082.70 per troy ounce
- Bitcoin: $78,688.77

============================================

CHART 1: Cu/Au LEADS Manufacturing by 6 Months
- Shows: Copper/Gold ratio (blue) vs Industrial Production (red, shifted 6mo forward)
- Key Finding: 0.845 correlation when ISM is shifted forward 6 months
- Pattern: Cu/Au bottoms predict manufacturing acceleration 3-6 months later
- Current Signal: Cu/Au at 0.001262 (lowest in 50 years) suggests manufacturing surge coming Q2-Q3 2026

============================================

CHART 2: Cu/Au vs S&P 500 (Risk Appetite)
- Shows: Both indexed to 100 (starting 2010)
- Key Finding: Strong positive correlation - both move together
- Pattern: When Cu/Au turns, equities follow
- Current Signal: Cu/Au at lows while S&P recovering = catch-up rally likely

============================================

CHART 3: Cu/Au vs Bitcoin (Cycle Timing)
- Shows: Cu/Au (blue) vs BTC price (orange, log scale)
- Marked Cycle Peaks: Nov 2013, Dec 2017, Nov 2021
- Key Finding: Cu/Au peaks preceded BTC cycle tops by 12-60 days in 2013, 2017, 2021
- Current Signal: Cu/Au at LOWS (not peaks) = we're EARLY in cycle, not late
- Implication: Months before next BTC top, altseason hasn't started

============================================

CHART 4: Liquidity Dashboard (4 Panels)
Panel 1 - SOFR-DFF Spread (Repo Stress):
  - Shows repo market stress over time
  - Current: Low/normalizing (down from Sept 2025 spike)
  - Signal: Repo stress easing

Panel 2 - M2 Money Supply:
  - Shows: $21.8 trillion and growing
  - Pattern: Growing again after 2022-2023 contraction
  - Signal: Liquidity expanding

Panel 3 - Fed Balance Sheet:
  - Shows: ~$7 trillion (down from $9T peak)
  - Pattern: QT slowing down
  - Signal: Fed pivot coming

Panel 4 - High Yield Spreads:
  - Shows: Corporate credit stress
  - Current: Near historical lows
  - Signal: Credit markets healthy, risk-on

Overall: ALL liquidity indicators confirm easing conditions

============================================

CHART 5: Cu/Au vs Dollar Index (Inverse)
- Shows: Cu/Au (blue) vs Trade-Weighted Dollar (brown, inverted axis)
- Key Finding: Inverse correlation - they move opposite
- Pattern: Weak dollar = strong Cu/Au = risk-on
- Current Signal: Dollar down ~10% in 2025 + Cu/Au lows = dual risk-on signal
- Implication: Dollar weakness adds fuel to risk rally

============================================

KEY STATISTICS TO USE:
- 0.845 correlation (Cu/Au vs manufacturing with 6mo shift) - THE KILLER STAT
- 0.518 correlation (Cu/Au vs manufacturing, no shift)
- 50-year lows (current ratio vs historical)
- 12-60 day lag (Cu/Au peaks to BTC cycle tops)
- -38.6% below average (current vs 2012-2025 mean)

============================================

THE THESIS IN ONE PARAGRAPH:
The copper/gold ratio at 50-year lows (0.001262) is a major risk-on signal that markets are missing. Historically, Cu/Au bottoms lead manufacturing acceleration by 6 months (0.845 correlation). All liquidity indicators confirm the turn: SOFR normalizing, M2 growing, Fed pivoting, credit spreads tight. Dollar weakness adds fuel. For crypto, Cu/Au peaks preceded BTC cycle tops in 2013/2017/2021 by 12-60 days - current lows mean we're EARLY in the cycle, not late. Expect ISM surge Q2-Q3 2026, followed by broad risk-on rally.
